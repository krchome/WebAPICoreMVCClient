# WebAPICoreMVCClient
A Client MVC Project that consumes a Web API in ASP.NET Core 3.1. The Web API uses MS SQL Server database to persist and the MVC Core application works with this database for CRUD operations. 
The Solution contains both the WEb API and the MVC Projects and should be made to start together in the Solution properties. Rest of the code is self explanatory.
